## Documentation

See:

* [Installation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/quick-start.html) for how to install this package and what it contains.
* [Editor lifecycle](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/legacy/getting-started/editor-lifecycle.html) for how to create an editor and interact with it.
* [Configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/setup/configuration.html) for how to configure the editor.
* [Creating custom builds](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/quick-start.html#building-the-editor-from-source) for how to customize the build (configure and rebuild the editor bundle).

## Quick start

First, install the build from npm:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon
```

And use it in your website:

```html
<div id="editor">
	<p>This is the editor content.</p>
</div>
<script src="./node_modules/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon/build/ckeditor.js"></script>
<script>
	BalloonEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.then( editor => {
			window.editor = editor;
		} )
		.catch( error => {
			console.error( 'There was a problem initializing the editor.', error );
		} );
</script>
```

Or in your JavaScript application:

```js
import BalloonEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon';

// Or using the CommonJS version:
// const BalloonEditor = require( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon' );

BalloonEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
	.then( editor => {
		window.editor = editor;
	} )
	.catch( error => {
		console.error( 'There was a problem initializing the editor.', error );
	} );
```

**Note:** If you are planning to integrate CKEditor&nbsp;5 deep into your application, it is actually more convenient and recommended to install and import the source modules directly (like it happens in `ckeditor.js`).
